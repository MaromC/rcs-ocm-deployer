# rcs-ocm-deployer
The `rcs-ocm-deployer` is an operator designed to deploy `knative service` workloads created on the hub to the managed cluster with the lowest load average on specific namespace.

## Open Cluster Management and Knative
This project uses the `Placement` and `ManifestWork` APIs of the Open Cluster Management (OCM) project. For more information please refer to the [OCM documentation](https://open-cluster-management.io/concepts/).

In order, please refer to the [Knative Serving documentation](https://knative.dev/docs/serving/) for more information about the `knative service` object.

## Description
### The Annotations
Two annotations are required in the `knative service` yaml:  

- `dana.io/ocm-placement: <PLACEMENT>` - The name of the placement to decide from which manage cluster to deploy on.
- `dana.io/ocm-managed-cluster-namespace: <MANAGED_CLUSTER_NS>` - The namespace on the managed cluster where `knative service` needs to be deployed.

### The controllers

1. `service placement controller`: The controller extracts the placement from the `knative serivce` annotation and adds an annotation containing the cluster where to deploy, in accordance to the `placementDesicion`.

2. `service namespace controller`: The controller extracts the namespace name from the `knative serivce` annotaion and creates a `ManifestWork` in the desired `ManagedCluster` namespace, which contains the namespace with the desired name to be deployed, and adds an annotation to the service when the namespace is created.

3. `service controller`: The controller extracts the namespace name and the desired cluster from the `knative serivce` annotations and creates a `ManifestWork` in the desired `ManagedCluster` namespace; the agent on the `ManagedCluster` takes care of deploying the `knative serivce` on the cluster itself.

## Getting Started
You‚Äôll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KinD](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Setting Up a Hub Cluster and Managed Clusters locally
The [OCM project](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/OCM) contains a script that allows spinning up a `KinD`-based environment, containing of a Hub Cluster and 2 Managed Clusters.

You can clone the repository and set up the environment, provided that you have `KinD` and `docker` installed on your machine. 

This script would create 3 clusters with the following Kubernetes contextes: 

- `kind-hub`
- `kind-cluster1`
- `kind-cluster2`

To switch between contexes, use `kubectl config set-context <CONTEXT_NAME>`

```
$ git clone https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/OCM
$ bash ./OCM/solutions/setup-dev-environment/local-up.sh
```

### Installing Knative
Follow the instructions of the Knative website to [install the Knative CLI](https://knative.dev/docs/getting-started/quickstart-install/#install-the-knative-cli), `kn`. Install Knative on the Managed Clusters:

```
$ kubectl config use-context kind-cluster1
$ kn quickstart kind --name cluster1

### Deploying the `rcs-ocm-deployer`
On the hub cluster, install just the Knative Service CRD:

```
$ kubectl apply -f hack/crds/knative-serving-crds.yaml
```

Use the `Makefile` in order to deploy controllers onto the Hub cluster. You can either push the image to a remote registry, using `docker-push`, or work locally without pusing the image.

When working locally:

```
$ kubectl config use-context kind-hub
```
```
$ make docker-build IMG=rcs-ocm-deployer:v0.1
$ kind load docker-image rcs-ocm-deployer:v0.1
$ make deploy IMG=rcs-ocm-deployer:v0.1
```
